// letâ€™s take an example and dry run on it to understand.

//   | 2 | 5 | 9 | 6 | 9 | 3 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 1 |
//    ---------------------------------------
//     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
    
    
//     2 -- 9 -- 1 -- 5
//          |         |
//          |         3

//          7 -- 8 -- 6

// Initially, we have 2, then we got to the second index, we have 9, then we go to the 9th index, we have 1, then we go to the 1st index, we again have 5, then we go to the 5th index, we have 3, then we go to the 3rd index, we get 6, then we go to the 6th index, we get 8, then we go to the 8th index, we get 7, then we go to the 7th index and we get 9 and here cycle is formed.
