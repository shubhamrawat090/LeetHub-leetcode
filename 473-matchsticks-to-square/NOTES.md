Base Conditions:
â€‹
1. totalSum = perimeter should be divisible by 4 to be able to form a square
2. matchsticks[i] <= totalSum/4, at all times i.e. a value cannot exceed side of the square.
3. sort the array in decreasing order to check if the maximum value is not exceeding the side of square, this will improve runtime.
